/// Authorization mechanic:
/// The Admin can authorize applications to access protected features of the

/// get mutable access to the `Registry` and add to the application `Balance`.
///
/// At any moment any of the applications can be deathorized by the Admin

/// Package Upgrades in mind:
/// - None of the public functions of the SuiNS feature any specific types -
/// instead we use generics to define the actual types in arbitrary modules.
/// - The `Registry` itself (the main feature of the application) is stored as
/// a dynamic field so that we can change the type and the module that serves
/// the registry without breaking the SuiNS compatibility.
/// - Any of the old modules can be deauthorized hence disabling its access to
/// the registry and the balance.
