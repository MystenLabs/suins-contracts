# TODO

This is a list of the remaining work to do:

- Checks everywhere to ensure that Domain:
    - Only has `sui` TLD
    - Only has 2 levels of labels: `brandon.sui` and not `pay.brandon.sui`
- Tests everywhere
- Ability to renew in controller
- Ability to register a 2 level domain in controller
- Ability to use discount/referral codes
- Think about adding more Admin capabilities
- Think about how to handle 1/2 character domains
