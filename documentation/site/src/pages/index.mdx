# SuiNS Documentation

Welcome to the Sui Name Service (SuiNS) documentation. SuiNS is a decentralized naming service on the Sui blockchain that enables users to replace complex wallet addresses with human-readable names.

Whether you're a **User** looking to establish your on-chain identity, a **Developer** integrating SuiNS into your applications, a **Node Operator** configuring name resolution, or a community member interested in **DAO** governance and **Communities**, you'll find comprehensive guides and resources here.

You can use the **SuiNS Dashboard** link in the top nav bar to jump over to SuiNS and start registering names, managing your existing names, or exploring community features.
