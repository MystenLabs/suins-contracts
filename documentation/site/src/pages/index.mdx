# SuiNS Documentation

Sui Name Service (SuiNS) documentation is divided into two main sections: [**User**](./user.mdx) and [**Developer**](./developer.mdx). The **Developer** section provides integration details for adding Sui Name Service (SuiNS) to your projects. The **User** section provides instructions on how to use the SuiNS portal to register names and integrate them with your Web3 identity.

You can use the **SuiNS Dashboard** link in the top nav bar to jump over to SuiNS and register some names, or configure the ones you already own.
