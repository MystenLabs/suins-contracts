# Building Transactions

`SuinsTransaction` is the client used similar to TransactionBlock, and helps in building a transaction.
You need to instatiate it once in every Programmable Transaction Block (PTB) that you're building.

## Available functions

Here's a list of all the available PTB commands supported through the SDK.

### Registering a name

```js

const register = async (name: string, years: number) => {
    // Query the latest pricelist from the chain.
    const priceList = await suinsClient.getPriceList();
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

	// We build the transaction to register the name.
	const nft = suinsTransaction.register({
		name,
		years,
		price: suinsClient.calculatePrice({ name, years, priceList }),
	});

    // Transfer the name's NFT
    transactionBlock.transferObjects([nft], transactionBlock.pure.address('0xMyAddress'));

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Renewing a name

```js
const renew = async (nftId: string, name: string, years: number) => {
    // Query the latest pricelist from the chain.
    const priceList = await suinsClient.getRenewalPriceList();
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to renew the name.
    suinsTransaction.renew({
        nftId,
        years,
        price: suinsClient.calculatePrice({ name, years, priceList }),
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Setting a name's target address

This works the same for names & subnames.

```js
const setTargetAddress = async (nftId: string, address: string) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to set the target address.
    suinsTransaction.setTargetAddress({
        nftId,
        address,
        isSubname: false,
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Setting a name as default

This works the same for names & subnames.

```js
const setDefault = async (name: string) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to set that name as default for the sender.
    // Important: This is only possible if the address signing/executing
    // the transaction is the same as the target address of that name.
    suinsTransaction.setDefault(name);

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Creating a Subname

```js
const createSubname = async (subName: string, parentNftId: string, expirationMs: number) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to create a subname.
	const subNameNft = suinsTxb.createSubName({
        // The NFT of the parent
        parentNft: parentNftId,
        // The subname to be created.
        name: subName,
        // The expiration timestamp needs to be less than or equal to the parent's expiration.
        expirationTimestampMs: expirationMs,
        // Whether the subname can create more nested subnames.
        // E.g. more.inner.sui could create even.more.inner.sui
        allowChildCreation: true,
        // Whether the subname can manually extend the expiration time to 
        // the expiration time of the parent name. Can be tweaked after creation too.
        allowTimeExtension: true,
    });

    // Transfer the NFT
    transactionBlock.transferObjects([subNameNft], transactionBlock.pure.address('0xMyAddress'));
    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Editing Subname's setup

Allows the parent holder to edit the setup (allow child creation / allow time extension) for a subname.

```js
const editSetup = async (name: stringify, parentNftId: string, allowChildCreation: boolean, allowTimeExtension: boolean) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to edit the setup of a subname.
    suinsTransaction.editSetup({
        name,
        parentNft: parentNftId,
        allowChildCreation,
        allowTimeExtension,
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Extending a Subname's expiration

This functionality is only available if the parent has allowed time extension for the subname.

```js
const extendExpiration = async (nftId: string, expirationMs: number) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to extend the expiration of a subname.
    suinsTransaction.extendExpiration({
        nft: nftId,
        expirationTimestampMs: expirationMs,
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Creating a leaf Subname

You can read more about the differences between a subname and a leaf subname [in this section](../subnames#subname-types).
    
```js
const createLeafSubname = async (name: stringify, parentNftId: string, targetAddress: string) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to create a leaf subname.
    // A leaf subname is a subname that has a target address and no NFT of its own.
    suinsTxb.createLeafSubName({
        // The NFT of the parent
        parentNft: parentNftId,
        // The leaf subname to be created.
        name,
        // the target address of the leaf subname (any valid Sui address)
        targetAddress
    });

    // Transfer the NFT
    transactionBlock.transferObjects([subNameNft], transactionBlock.pure.address('0xMyAddress'));
    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Removing a leaf Subname

```js
const removeLeafSubname = async (name: string, parentNftId: string) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to remove a leaf subname.
    suinsTxb.removeLeafSubName({
        // The NFT of the parent
        parentNft: parentNftId,
        // The leaf subname to be removed.
        name,
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Setting a name's metadata

Currently supports AVATAR & IPFS Hash.

```js
const setMetadata = async (nft: string, avatar: string, contentHash: string) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to set the metadata.
    // set the avatar to the supplied value
    suinsTransaction.setMetadata({
        nft,
        key: ALLOWED_METADATA.avatar,
        value: avatar
    });
    // set the contentHash to the supplied value
    suinsTransaction.setMetadata({
        nft,
        key: ALLOWED_METADATA.contentHash,
        value: contentHash
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```

### Burning an expired name

Allows burning an expired name to get back storage rebates.

```js
const burn = async (nftId: string) => {
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

    // We build the transaction to burn the expired name.
    suinsTransaction.burn({
        nft: nftId,
        // whether it's a subname or not.
        isSubname: false,
    });

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```


## Combined Examples

### Registration, setting target address, making the name default
We can use the following snippet to register a SuiNS name, set its target address, and set it as the default name for the target address
in a single PTB. We can do even more if we want to, like create subnames etc.

```js
// Years must be between 1-5.
const composedExample = async (name: string, years: number) => {
    // Query the latest pricelist from the chain.
    const priceList = await suinsClient.getPriceList();
    
    // We create a transaction block as usual in our PTBs
    const transactionBlock = new TransactionBlock();
    // We pass in the transaction block & our app's global SuinsClient.
    const suinsTransaction = new SuinsTransaction(suinsClient, transactionBlock);

	// We build the transaction to register the name.
	const nft = suinsTransaction.register({
		name,
		years,
		price: suinsClient.calculatePrice({ name, years, priceList }),
	});

    // We can now use this NFT, for instance to set its target address
	suinsTransaction.setTargetAddress({
		nft,
		address: '0xMyAddress',
	});

    // And we could also set this name as our default name for `0xMyAddress`
    // This is only possible if the address signing/executing the transaction 
	suinsTransaction.setDefault(name);

    // Transfer the name's NFT to the address
    transactionBlock.transferObjects([nft], transactionBlock.pure.address('0xMyAddress'));

    // ... sign and execute the transaction
}
```
