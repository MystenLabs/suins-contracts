# SuiNS Documentation

SuiNS documentation is a place to find the available ways of integration with SuiNS.

This includes ways to integrate using both the on-chain resolution, as well as off-chain resolution,
based on the use-case.


## Active Constants

This is a list of our current active objects to interact with SuiNS. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It's recommended to look here for the latest state, as some of the active constants might be changed.
  That mostly applies to secondary packages responsible for registering a name, renewing a name & utilities.
  The core package cannot change, nor can the core SuiNS object.
