# Sui Name Service User Documentation

Build your on-chain identity in web3 with Sui Name Service (SuiNS). Using SuiNS, you can register a name (any name that isn't already registered) and use it for on-chain transactions. 

You can use the **SuiNS Dashboard** link in the top nav bar to jump over to SuiNS and register some names, or configure the ones you already own.
