1. Hover your cursor over or tap the icon for the name you want to change and click the ellipses (...) that appears in the upper-right corner to open the context menu for the name.
1. Select **Renew name** from the menu to open the dialog.
1. Use the **Registration Period** field to set the number of years to retain the rights to the name. The maximum value is five years minus the current registration period.

### Renewal grace period
