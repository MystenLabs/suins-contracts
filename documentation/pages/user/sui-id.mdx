# sui.id

Using [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), you can create a `sui.id` address connected to your SuiNS name to claim a spot on the decentralized web. The IPFS protocol enables hosting peer-to-peer static sites or media that you can associate with your SuiNS name.

You need a content identifier (CID) to map your SuiNS name to your IPFS asset. To get the CID, download and use the [IPFS desktop app](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) for your operating system. 

1. Open the IPFS desktop app. 
1. Select the **FILES** option from the main menu and import relevant files into IPFS.
1. Tap or click the ellipses (...) for the uploaded file or folder that you want to have your sui.id name point to and select **Copy CID**.
1. Navigate a browser to [suins.io](https://suins.io/).
1. Tap or click the **Connect Wallet** button in the upper right.
