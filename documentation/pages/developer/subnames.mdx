# Subnames
Subnames are nested names under a parent name. Unlike the creation of regular names, subnames can be created without any cost.

**The maximum nesting depth is 8 levels**, meaning that the total depth can be up to 10 levels, including the SLD and TLD.

The parent can decide whether a subname can create more nested names or not. The parent can also decide to allow a subname to 
extend the expiration to match the parent's expiration. This can be altered by the parent at any time, but revoking/burning follows the 
same rules as described below.

## Subname Types
Subnames are split into two different types: 
1. **Node subnames**: Similar to regular names, they have an NFT associated with them that gives access to all extra features (personalization, avatars, etc).
2. **Leaf subnames**: These are subnames that are created under a node subname. They do not have an NFT associated with them, they are only controlled by the parent.
and they are usually used programmatically.

To understand the differences, the following table gives more information:

| Capabilities / Category | Node Names | Leaf Names |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has NFT | ✅ Yes, `SuinsRegistration` for SLD*, and `SubDomainRegistration` for nested names | ❌ parent's NFT acts as the capability |
| Can create children (node/leaf) | ✅ Yes as long as they are an SLD* or it is allowed by their parent | ❌ |
| Expiration | ✅ Expiration is determined by SuiNS (if SLD) or parent | ❌ Expiration is derived by the parent's expiration |
| Extend Expiration | ✅ Expiration can be extended if parent allows it (or by paying for it for SLD) | ✅ Leaf names do not expire |
| Target Address | ✅ NFT holder can update the target address; Address can be empty | ✅ Active Parent's NFT holder can update the target address; Address cannot be empty |
| Reverse registry | ✅ | ✅ |
| Revoke | ❌ A node name can't be removed (only when expired) | ✅ Active parent holder can remove a leaf name |
| Burn | ✅  Post-expiration only | ✅ Burn & Revoking is the same for leaf names. |
| Transfer Ownership | ✅ A node name ownership is determined by the NFT | ❌ Ownership is preserved for the active parent name holder. |

## Integration

Similar to regular names, subnames can be looked-up through JSONRPC as well as GraphQL, as well as get looked-up [on-chain as described here](./integration.mdx).


## Creating subnames

TODO: Show how someone could create subnames through the SDK (being the parent).

TODO: Show how someone can integrate with the subdomains package to create subnames.
