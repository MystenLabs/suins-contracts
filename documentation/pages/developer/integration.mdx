# Integration

Integration with SuiNS works in multiple ways. For dApps it's most usual that integration refers to off-chain resolution through RPCs
in order to interact or display names instead of addresses (e.g. create transactions that send assets to names, or showing the names instead of addresses
in a leaderboard).

Resolution works in two ways: 
1. Lookup: A name can point to an address or an object (e.g. `example.sui` pointing to `0x2`).
2. Reverse lookup: An address can have a default name (e.g. `0x2` having the default `example.sui`).


## Off-Chain Resolution

For off-chain resolution, both JSONRPC and GraphQL endpoints are available.

[You can find the JSONRPC endpoints by clicking here.](https://docs.sui.io/sui-api-ref#suix_resolvenameserviceaddress)

[You can find the GraphQL endpoints by clicking here](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/api/queries/resolve-suins-address)

*for GraphQL's default name resolution, there's a `defaultSuinsName` field you can use. [You can find more info by clicking here](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/address)*


## On-chain Resolution

You can use SuiNS Core package as a dependency to your own package, if you wish to do on-chain resolution.

    You can use the dependency on your `Move.toml` file as follows:
    ```sh
    [dependencies]
    suins = { git = "https://github.com/mystenlabs/suins-contracts/", subdir = "packages/suins", rev = "mainnet" }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    ```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We recommend only integrating on-chain with the Core package, and not the utility packages as it is likely they will be replaced
  and become non-functional.
