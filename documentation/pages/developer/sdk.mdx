# SuiNS SDK

Use the SuiNS SDK to interact with the Sui Name Service. Query SuiNS data in a usable way and build transactions that interact with service names.

## Installation

<Tabs items={['Using @mysten/sui', 'Using @mysten/sui.js']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    To use with the latest version of the Typescript SDK, install using:
    ```sh npm2yarn
    npm i @mysten/suins
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
      <Tabs.Tab>
      To use with the older version (prior to 1.x) of the Typescript SDK (0.54.1), install using:
      ```sh npm2yarn
    npm i @mysten/suins@0.0.3
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    </Tabs>

## `SuinsClient`

`SuinsClient` is the base for all SuiNS functionality.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    You should keep only one instance of `SuinsClient` throughout your dApp, API, or script. For example, in React, you should use a context to provide the client.
</Callout>

## Initializing a `SuinsClient`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
    Always keep the dependency updated so you get the latest constants. If you don't, some of your transactions might fail to build.
</Callout>

You can initialize a `SuinsClient` by either providing the active network (`mainnet`/`testnet`),
or by passing in the constants (usable for any network).

```js
import { SuinsClient } from '@mysten/suins';
import { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui/client';

// You need a Sui client. You can re-use the Sui client of your project
// (it's not recommended to create a new one).
const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet') });

// Now you can use it to create a SuiNS client.
const suinsClient = new SuinsClient({
	client,
	network: 'testnet',
});
```
