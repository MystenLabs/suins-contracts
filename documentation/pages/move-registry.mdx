# Move Registry

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Move Registry (MVR, pronounced "mover") provides a uniform naming service for interacting and building with packages from the Sui ecosystem. This means that you can reference packages by their names, and MVR resolves the package address for you, despite the network.

Use MVR to: 

- Reference both packages and types by name in programmable transaction blocks (PTBs).
- Depend on other packages when developing with Move.

Additionally, MVR can help you manage package versioning. With MVR, you call a specific version of a package without having to resolve the addresses yourself. You also don't need to worry about the package being updated, because if you use a name without a specified version, MVR automatically defaults to the latest version available.
