# Move Registry

Move Registry is built to provide a name service for interacting / building with packages from the ecosystem. You could consider it the name service for packages.

Move Registry is currently used for the following scenarios: 

1. To reference packages and types in PTBs using their names.
2. To depend on other packages when developing with Move.

## Why would I use the Move Registry?

Move Registry provides a uniform (single source of truth) naming service for packages in the Move ecosystem. 
This means that you can reference packages by their names, and the Move Registry will resolve the package address for you, despite the network*.

Additionally, Move Registry helps with working with versioning of packages. You can call a specific version of a package easily, without having to 
resolve the addresses yourself, or worry about the package being updated (name without a specified version defaults to the latest).


*Move Registry default service currently supports Mainnet and testnet.*
