# Indexing

The indexer enables more expressive queries about the active domain state, as the on-chain resolution wasn't enough to power the interface.

This allows for complex queries such as:

- **Get all the subnames for a given parent:** Retrieve every subdomain linked to a parent domain, enhancing the ability to manage and analyze domain structures.
- **Get all names pointing to a specified address:** Identify all domain names associated with a specific wallet address to track ownership and usage.

You can find the indexer in the [suins-indexer GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/suins-indexer). 
Feel free to spin up your own service if you're looking to index data tailored to your needs.

For a deeper understanding of how the indexer works and how to integrate it into your projects, refer to [Sui's custom indexer documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/advanced/custom-indexer).
