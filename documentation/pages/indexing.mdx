# Indexing

The reason we built an indexer was to enable more expressive queries about the active domain state, as the on-chain resolution wasn't enough to power our
interface.

This allows us to run complex queries such as:

- **Get all the subnames for a given parent:** Easily retrieve every subdomain linked to a parent domain, enhancing the ability to manage and analyze domain structures.
- **Get all names pointing to a specified address:** Identify all domain names that are associated with a specific wallet address, which is invaluable for tracking ownership and usage.

You can find the indexer in the [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/suins-indexer). 
Feel free to spin up your own service if you're looking to index data tailored to your needs.

For a deeper understanding of how our indexer works and how to integrate it into your projects, please refer to [Sui's custom indexer documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/advanced/custom-indexer).
