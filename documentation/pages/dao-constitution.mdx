# SuiNS DAO Constitution (TBD, Voting Proposal)

The SuiNS DAO (Sui Name Service DAO) is a decentralized autonomous organization established to govern the SuiNS protocol. Our mission is to provide a decentralized, user-friendly naming system on the Sui blockchain, ensuring fair access and sustainable development. This constitution outlines the fundamental principles and governance mechanisms of the SuiNS DAO.

## Article I – Fee structure

**Purpose of Fees:** Fees are instituted primarily as a regulatory mechanism to manage the namespace effectively and prevent excessive speculative registrations. They also generate necessary revenue for  proposed improvements of SuiNS. Fees will be adjusted as needed to ensure they fulfill these purposes without placing undue burdens on users.

## Article II – Allocation of revenue

**Use of Income:** The revenue generated by SuiNS will ensure the sustainability and advancement of the SuiNS system. 

## Article III – Integration with existing systems

**Global Compatibility:** SuiNS strives to work harmoniously with existing naming conventions like DNS, ensuring compatibility without compromising decentralization. The DAO will facilitate the integration of top-level domains with their legitimate owners while avoiding the creation of new domains without proper authorization. This approach helps maintain a decentralized yet universally compatible system.

## Article IV – Protection of name ownership

**User Rights:** The SuiNS DAO is committed to ensuring that users retain full control over the names they own. Governance decisions will not prevent users from owning, managing, transferring, or renewing their names. Changes affecting registration or renewal costs will be based on transparent criteria and apply uniformly to avoid discrimination against specific users.

## Article V – Amending the constitution

**Procedure for Amendments:** Changes to this constitution require a two third’s vote. This ensures that amendments reflect the collective will of the community and maintain the integrity of the governance process.
