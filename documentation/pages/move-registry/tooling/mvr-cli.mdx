# MVR CLI

MVR CLI is used to manage your package dependencies and to interact with the Move Registry. It is a command-line tool that allows you to:

1. Add dependencies to your Move project.
2. Build your Move project with MVR dependencies.


## Installation

To install the MVR CLI, you can use the following command:

```bash
TODO: add installation command
```

## Adding dependencies

To add a dependency to your move code, you can use the `mvr add` command. This command will add the dependency to your `Move.toml` file.

```bash
mvr add <package_name> --network <mainnet|testnet>
```

Using this, a new entry will be added to your `Move.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
...
app = { r.mvr = "@mvr/app" }

[r.mvr]
network = "mainnet"
```

## Building against MVR dependencies

You can use `sui move build` as usual, and the MVR CLI will be automatically invoked to resolve dependencies and build your project.

```bash
sui move build
```
