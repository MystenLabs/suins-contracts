# Design of the Move Registry

Before diving into specifics, we first need to analyze the design. The Move Registry consists of two independent components:

1. Package Info registration: Exists independently on each network.
2. Move Registry: A single source of truth located on mainnet.

## Package Info objects

The first step when publishing a package is to register its metadata object. This metadata object serves as a key source of information for:

1. Locating the source code across different versions of the package.
2. (Future) Providing text-based metadata (title, description, tags) for the package, which can be used in the MVR search engine.

This metadata object can be reused when authorizing any package upgrades to supply source information for the new version. 
It is designed to be indexable by Sui Indexers, as it cannot be stored within another object.

## Move Registry

Move Registry registration is separate from the PackageInfo registration process. This separation is necessary because the PackageInfo object acts as both the source of truth for package metadata and a proof of package ownership, whereas the Move Registry is used to register applications that can be resolved using MVR tooling.

The steps to register a package are as follows:

1. Using your SuiNS name, register an application.
2. Based on the network, associate the application name with a `PackageInfo` object:
- **Mainnet**: Associate the application name with a complete PackageInfo object, which provides the full metadata and ownership proof.
- **Other Networks**: Associate the application name with only the PackageInfo object ID, acting as a pointer without ensuring a full mapping.
