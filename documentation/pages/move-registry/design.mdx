# Design of the Move Registry

The Move Registry (MVR, pronounced "mover") consists of two independent components:

- `PackageInfo` registration: Exists independently on each network.
- MVR registration: A single source of truth located on Mainnet.

The following diagram shows the MVR design at a high level.

## PackageInfo objects

The first step when publishing a package is to register its metadata object. This metadata object serves as a key source of information for:

1. Locating the source code across different versions of the package.
2. (Future) Providing text-based metadata (title, description, tags) for the package, which the MVR search engine can use.

This metadata object can be reused when authorizing any package upgrades to supply source information for the new version.
Sui indexers can index the metadata as it cannot be stored within another object.

See [Managing Package Metadata](./managing-package-info.mdx) for examples of working with `PackageInfo` objects.

## MVR name

A MVR name consists of a SuiNS name and a package name, in the format `<suins_name>/<pkg_name>`.
As an example, if your SuiNS name is `myname.sui`, and your package name is `mypackage`,
the MVR name can be `@myname/mypackage` or `myname.sui/mypackage`.

The MVR standard supports an optional `/<version>` that allows you to specify which on-chain version
to resolve to. As an example, if your MVR name is `@myname/mypackage` and there are multiple versions
of the package, you can specify `@myname/mypackage/2` to use version 2.

## MVR registration

MVR registration is separate from the `PackageInfo` registration process. This separation is necessary because the `PackageInfo` object acts as both the source of truth for package metadata and a proof of package ownership, whereas MVR registers applications that MVR tooling can resolve.

To register a package:

1. Using your SuiNS name, register an application.
2. Based on the network, associate the application name with a `PackageInfo` object:
- **Mainnet:** Associate the application name with a complete `PackageInfo` object, which provides the full metadata and ownership proof.
- **Other networks:** Associate the application name with the `PackageInfo` object ID, acting as a pointer without ensuring a full mapping.
