# Design of the Move Registry

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

The Move Registry (MVR, pronounced "mover") consists of two independent components:

- PackageInfo registration: Exists independently on each network.
- Move Registry: A single source of truth located on Mainnet.

The following diagram shows the Mover design at a high level.

## PackageInfo objects

The first step when publishing a package is to register its metadata object. This metadata object serves as a key source of information for:

1. Locating the source code across different versions of the package.
2. (Future) Providing text-based metadata (title, description, tags) for the package, which can be used in the MVR search engine.

This metadata object can be reused when authorizing any package upgrades to supply source information for the new version. 
It is designed to be indexable by Sui Indexers, as it cannot be stored within another object.

## MVR registration

MVR registration is separate from the `PackageInfo` registration process. This separation is necessary because the `PackageInfo` object acts as both the source of truth for package metadata and a proof of package ownership, whereas MVR registers applications that MVR tooling can resolve.

To register a package:

1. Using your SuiNS name, register an application.
2. Based on the network, associate the application name with a `PackageInfo` object:
- **Mainnet:** Associate the application name with a complete `PackageInfo` object, which provides the full metadata and ownership proof.
- **Other networks:** Associate the application name with the `PackageInfo` object ID, acting as a pointer without ensuring a full mapping.
