# Best Practises

For package authors/maintainers, the following best practises are recommended when saving your source code to make sure
that your package is easily usable by other developers.

1. Whenever you publish/upgrade a package, you need to use the [Automated Address Management](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/packages/automated-address-management)
2. It's recommended to switch your `Sui` dependency to the correct network you're publishing/upgrading against (e.g. `framework/testnet` for testnet, `framework/mainnet` for mainnet).
3. After properly configuring your Automated Address Management, you should commit your changes to your git repository.
4. Make sure this commit is also tagged OR is part of your main branch. A good practise is tagging your releases with network/verson (e.g. `mainnet/v1`).
5. You can then use the commit SHA or the tag to update the source code origin in the `PackageInfo` object.
