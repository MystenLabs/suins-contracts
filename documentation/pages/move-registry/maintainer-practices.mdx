# Best Practices

For package authors and maintainers, the following best practices are recommended for working with the Move Registry. Following these tips ensures that other builders can use your package as intended.

## Automated Address Management

- Whenever you publish or upgrade a package, use the Sui Automated Address Management feature.
- After properly configuring your Automated Address Management, commit and [tag](#tagging) your changes to your git repository.

For more information, see [Automated Address Management](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/packages/automated-address-management) in the Sui documentation. 

## Sui dependency

Switch your `Sui` dependency to the correct network you're publishing or upgrading against (for example, `framework/testnet` for Testnet, `framework/mainnet` for Mainnet).

## Tagging

Proper use of tags helps code maintenance.

- Tag your releases with `<network>/<verson>` (for example, `mainnet/v1`). Make sure the commit you push after configuring [Automated Address Management](#automated-address-management) is also tagged, or is part of your `main` branch.
- After applying a release tag, use the commit SHA or the tag to update the source code origin in the `PackageInfo` object.
