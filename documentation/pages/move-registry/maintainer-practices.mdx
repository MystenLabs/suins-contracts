# Best Practices

For package authors and maintainers, the following best practices are recommended when saving your source code. Following these tips ensures that other builders can use your package as intended.

1. Whenever you publish or upgrade a package, use the [Automated Address Management](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/packages/automated-address-management) feature.
1. Switch your `Sui` dependency to the correct network you're publishing or upgrading against (for example, `framework/testnet` for Testnet, `framework/mainnet` for Mainnet).
1. After properly configuring your Automated Address Management, commit your changes to your git repository.
1. Make sure this commit is also tagged, or is part of your main branch. A good practice is to tag your releases with `<network>/<verson>` (for example, `mainnet/v1`).
1. If tagged, use the commit SHA or the tag to update the source code origin in the `PackageInfo` object.
