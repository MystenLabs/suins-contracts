# Best Practices

For package authors and maintainers, the following best practices are recommended for working with the Move Registry. Following these tips ensures that other builders can use your package as intended.

## Automated Address Management

- Whenever you publish or upgrade a package, use the Sui Automated Address Management feature.
- After properly configuring your Automated Address Management, commit and [tag](#tagging) your changes to your git repository.

For more information, see [Automated Address Management](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/packages/automated-address-management) in the Sui documentation. 

## Sui dependency

Switch your `Sui` dependency to the correct network you're publishing or upgrading against (for example, `framework/testnet` for Testnet, `framework/mainnet` for Mainnet).

> Starting from Sui v1.45, you should remove the Sui framework and all other system dependencies from your Move.toml file, as they are now automatically added and managed when used.

## Tagging

Proper use of tags or commit SHAs helps code maintenance.

- Tag your releases with `<network>/<version>` (for example, `mainnet/v1`). Make sure the commit you push after configuring [Automated Address Management](#automated-address-management) is also tagged, or is part of your `main` branch.
- After applying a release tag, use the commit SHA or the tag to update the source code origin in the `PackageInfo` object.

## Naming your package

In a multi-package repository, it's common to use generic names for packages, such as utils or math. However, this can cause confusion when others try to use your packages or when your packages depend on similarly named ones.

To avoid this, it's best to prefix your package names with the project name. For example, instead of running:

```
sui move new utils
```

You should instead run:

```
sui move new mvr_utils
```

This makes it clear which packages belong to your project, improving organization and usability for others.
