## Looking up a name

You can perform on-chain lookups for names for various examples in your packages.
For example, to transfer some tokens to a given address:

```rust
use suins::{ 
  suins,
  registry::{Self, Registry},
  name_record::NameRecord,
  domain
}

// Find the name_record on-chain for a given domain.
// that way we can check if it's expired, whether it points to an address etc.
fun get_name_record(suins: &SuiNS, name: String) {
    let name_record = registry::lookup(suins.registry(), name.new());
}

/// Gives access to the main registry
fun registry(suins: &SuiNS): &Registry {
    suins.registry<Registry>()
}
```
