Build your on-chain identity in Web3 with Sui Name Service (SuiNS). Using SuiNS, you can register a name (any name that is not already registered) and use it for on-chain transactions. 

You can use the **SuiNS Dashboard** link in the top nav bar to jump over to SuiNS and register some names, or configure the ones you already own.

## Register names {#register-names}

To enjoy the benefits of SuiNS, you must first register names. When you register available names, you purchase the rights to those names for one year. After registration, you can [renew your names](#renew-names) for multiple years.

To register a name:

1. Go to the [SuiNS site](https://suins.io/) and tap or click the name search bar to open the SuiNS search dialog. This search bar is available at the top of the site when navigating the dashboard.

    </div>
1. Type a name of interest in the search field between 3 and 63 characters, inclusive. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or tap or click the magnifying glass icon to initiate the search. Search results show whether the name is available and the price in SUI for one year of registration. 
1. Tap or click a name to open the **Register Name** dialog.
    <div className="w-[600px]">
    ![Register name](/img/ui/register-name.png)
    </div>
1. Tap or click the **Set as Default** toggle to identify whether the name should be default for the address, apply a coupon code if you have one, then tap or click **Register name**. 
1. Approve the transaction using your connected wallet. If registration is successful, SuiNS opens the **Names** page of the dashboard. The new name appears in the list. If there is an error, fix the issue SuiNS raises and try again.

## Renew names {#renew-names}

You can renew, or extend the expiration date, for any of your registered names for up to 5 years.

1. Select **Renew name** from the menu to open the dialog.
1. Use the **Registration Period** field to set the number of years to retain the rights to the name. The maximum value is 5 years minus the current registration period. So, if you just registered the name, the maximum number of years you can renew is 4. As you increase or decrease the value, SuiNS updates the amount in SUI and the registration expiration date based on the value.
    <div className="w-[600px]">
    ![Extend](/img/ui/renew.png)
    </div>
1. Tap or click **Extend Name Expiry** button. 
1. Approve the transaction using your connected wallet. 

### Renewal grace period

When the current date surpasses the last day of your registration period, the SuiNS name expires. You have a 30-day grace period within which you can renew the registration. After that, you must [register](#register-names) the name again, if it is available.

## sui.id {#sui-id}

Using [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), you can create a `sui.id` address connected to your SuiNS name to claim a spot on the decentralized web. The IPFS protocol enables hosting peer-to-peer static sites or media that you can associate with your SuiNS name. 

<Video videoId="cdHzHkjWQ3A"/>

You need a content identifier (CID) to map your SuiNS name to your IPFS asset. To get the CID, download and use the [IPFS desktop app](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) for your operating system.

1. After connecting, the **Connect Wallet** button displays your address (or connected SuiNS default name). Tap or click the button to open the account dialog.
