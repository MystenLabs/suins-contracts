SuiNS Communities is a social identity layer on Sui that enables users to join ecosystem-specific communities by claiming subnames and unlock access to community-specific features, analytics, and subname distribution mechanics. Each community gets its own dynamic Community Page, with real-time stats, token/NFT insights, and social layer tooling — all governed through a powerful management dashboard for TLD owners.
