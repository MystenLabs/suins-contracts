Use the MVR CLI to manage your package dependencies and to interact with the Move Registry (MVR). The MVR CLI is a command line tool that enables:

- Adding dependencies to your Move project.
- Building your Move project with MVR dependencies.

## Installation

There are several ways to install the MVR CLI tool.

### Cargo

Use the following command to install using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/mystenlabs/mvr --branch release mvr
```

### From binaries

Download the correct binary file for your OS and architecture from the [MVR GitHub release page](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mvr/releases/latest):

After downloading the file, rename the binary to `mvr` and add its location to your system `PATH` variable.

<Tabs groupId='packagemanagers'>
  <TabItem label="Zsh" value='zsh'>
  1. Open your `.zshrc` file. This file is typically located at `~/.zshrc` in MacOS. If it doesn't exist, create it.
  ```sh
  $ nano ~/.zshrc
  ```
  1. Update or add the following `export PATH` command. Be sure to change `/path/to/your/folder` to match your folder path. Separate all paths using a colon, if necessary.
  ```sh
  export PATH="/path/to/your/folder:$PATH"
  ```
  1. Save the file and use the `source` command to apply changes.
  ```sh
  $ source ~/.zshrc
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bash" value='bash'>
  1. Open your `.bashrc` file (or `.bash_profile` on macOS). This file is typically located at `~/.bashrc` in macOS. If it doesn't exist, create it.
  ```sh
  $ nano ~/.bashrc
  ```
  1. Update or add the following `export PATH` command. Be sure to change `/path/to/your/folder` to match your folder path. Separate all paths using a colon, if necessary.
  ```sh
  export PATH="/path/to/your/folder:$PATH"
  ```
  1. Save the file and use the `source` command to apply changes.
  ```sh
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="fish" value='fish'>
  1. Open your fish configuration file. 
  ```sh
  $ nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish
  ```
  1. Add the following command to the configuration. Be sure to change `/path/to/your/folder` to match your folder path.
  ```sh
  set -Ux fish_user_paths /path/to/your/folder $fish_user_paths
  ```
  1. Save the file. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows" value='windows'>
  1. In Search, search for and then select: **System (Control Panel)**.
  1. Click the **Advanced system settings** link.
  1. Click **Environment Variables**. In the section **System Variables** find the **PATH** environment variable and select it. Click **Edit**. If the **PATH** environment variable does not exist, click **New**.
  1. In the **Edit System Variable** (or **New System Variable**) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable. Click **OK**. Close all remaining windows by clicking **OK**.
  </TabItem>

### From source

To install from source:

1. Clone the `mvr` repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mystenlabs/mvr.git
    ```
1. Open a console or terminal to the `mvr/mvr-cli` directory of the repository.
    ```sh
    cd mvr/mvr-cli && 
    ```
1. Use `cargo` to install from current directory.
    ```sh
    cargo install --path .
    ```

<div className="nx-pt-6">
:::info
After completing your install from one of the above methods, use a terminal or console to verify installation by typing `mvr --help` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. If your operating system does not recognize the command, then retry the installation steps.

## Adding dependencies

To add a dependency to your Move code, use the `mvr add` command. This command adds the dependency to your `Move.toml` file.

```sh
mvr add <package_name> --network <mainnet|testnet>
```

MVR adds a new entry to your `Move.toml` file. The following shows an example of the information that MVR adds.

```toml
[dependencies]
...
app = { r.mvr = "@mvr/app" }

[r.mvr]
network = "mainnet"
```

## Building against MVR dependencies

Use `sui move build` as usual when building Move packages. The command automatically invokes MVR CLI to resolve dependencies and build your project.

```bash
sui move build
```
