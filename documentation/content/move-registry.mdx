Move Registry (MVR, pronounced mover) provides a uniform naming service for interacting and building with packages from the Sui ecosystem. This means that you can reference packages by their names, and MVR resolves the package address for you, despite the network.

You can access the front end of the Move Registry online at https://www.moveregistry.com/apps.

Use MVR to:

- Reference both packages and types by name in programmable transaction blocks (PTBs).

- Depend on other packages when developing with Move.

Additionally, MVR can help you manage package versioning. With MVR, you call a specific version of a package without having to resolve the addresses yourself. You also do not need to worry about the package being updated, because if you use a name without a specified version, MVR automatically defaults to the latest version available.

MVR default service currently supports Mainnet and Testnet networks.

## Design

- `PackageInfo` registration: Exists independently on each network.
- MVR registration: A single source of truth located on Mainnet.

The following diagram shows the MVR design at a high level.

## `PackageInfo` objects

The first step when publishing a package is to register its metadata object. This metadata object serves as a key source of information for:

1. Locating the source code across different versions of the package.
2. (Future) Providing text-based metadata (title, description, tags) for the package, which the MVR search engine can use.

This metadata object can be reused when authorizing any package upgrades to supply source information for the new version. Sui indexers can index the metadata as it cannot be stored within another object.

See [Managing Package Metadata](./move-registry/managing-package-info.mdx) for examples of working with `PackageInfo` objects.

## MVR name

A MVR name consists of a SuiNS name and a package name, in the format `<suins_name>/<pkg_name>`. For example, if your SuiNS name is `myname.sui`, and your package name is `mypackage`, the MVR name can be `@myname/mypackage` or `myname.sui/mypackage`.

The MVR standard supports an optional `/<version>` that allows you to specify which on-chain version to resolve to. For example, if your MVR name is `@myname/mypackage` and there are multiple versions of the package, you can specify `@myname/mypackage/2` to use version 2.

## MVR registration

MVR registration is separate from the `PackageInfo` registration process. This separation is necessary because the `PackageInfo` object acts as both the source of truth for package metadata and a proof of package ownership, whereas MVR registers applications that MVR tooling can resolve.

To register a package:

1. Using your SuiNS name, register an application.
2. Based on the network, associate the application name with a `PackageInfo` object:
- **Mainnet:** Associate the application name with a complete `PackageInfo` object, which provides the full metadata and ownership proof.
- **Other networks:** Associate the application name with the `PackageInfo` object ID, acting as a pointer without ensuring a full mapping.

The registry that stores name resolution for MVR exists only on Mainnet.
